** List all the actors (first and last name) who acted in at least one film in the 80s (1980-1990, both ends inclusive) and in at least one film in the 21st century (>=2000). Sort alphabetically, by the actor's last and first name.
** List all the movies (title, year) that were released in the same year as the movie entitled `"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"`, but had a better rank (Note: the higher the value in the *rank* attribute, the better the rank of the movie). Sort alphabetically, by movie title.  
** Find the actor(s) (first and last name) who **only** acted in films released before 1980. Sort alphabetically, by the actor's last and first name.  
** List the top 10 directors in descending order of the number of films they directed (first name, last name, number of films directed). For simplicity, feel free to ignore ties at the number 10 spot (i.e., always show up to 10 only). Sort alphabetically, by the number of films (descending), the actor's last name and first name.  
** Find all the actors who have worked with at least 7 different directors. Do not consider cases of self-directing (i.e., when the director is also an actor in a movie), but count all directors in a movie towards the threshold of 7 directors. Show the actor's first, last name, and the number of directors he/she has worked with. Sort in decreasing order of number of directors.
** Assume that the *popularity* of an actor is reflected by the average *rank* of all the movies he/she has acted in. Find the top 20 most popular actors (in descreasing order of popularity) -- list the actor's first/last name, the total number of movies he/she has acted, and his/her popularity score. For simplicity, feel free to ignore ties at the number 20 spot (i.e., always show up to 20 only).
